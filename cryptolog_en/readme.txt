This version of the software is a demonstration version, it lacks many functions.
The actual version is for beginners, the professional version will be uploaded online as soon as possible.
This version is in the console mode, a version with graphical user interface is being developed.
While waiting the first distribution, you can execute Cryptolog with Python3 and Stegano with Python2.
If Python is not installed on your computer you must install it, and you must also install the libraries, "stepic" and "Image".
If Cryptolog asks you to choose a category, a servive ..., just type its number (example: 3).
If Cryptolog asks you a question with "[y/n]" at the end, enter 'y' for yes or 'n' for no.

Read the project sheet and consult the poster for more details on the software and its conception.
